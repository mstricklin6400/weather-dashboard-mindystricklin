I used the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather based on user input. When the user enters a city name and clicks “Get Weather,” the app sends a GET request and displays the current temperature and description. I added a feature where an avatar image changes based on the weather type (e.g., sunglasses for sunny, umbrella for rainy). A challenge I faced was that emoji characters didn’t render correctly on my Windows system, so I switched to using image avatars instead. Next, I plan to implement the Weather History Tracker and save data to a CSV file.
